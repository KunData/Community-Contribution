#### ggplot2 is a powerful R package for data visualization. However, it is quite challenging to draw a Diverging Stacked Bar Chart for data from Likert-Type Scales by using ggplot2. After careful research, I found an approach to plot this type of bar graph with ggplot2 and present it as my Community Contribution to EDAV course at Columbia. ####

#### A ggplot2-based approach to draw a Diverging Stacked Bar Chart for Likert-Type data with or without Neutral kept is presented. Please see this work and the resulting graphs at: https://kundata.github.io/Community-Contribution/index.html ####
